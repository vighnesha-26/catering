                        Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has
                        become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest
                        of people regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of the top
                        fashion magazines. Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in 2017.

                        Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential
                        across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance,
                        auto manufacturing, property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she has
                        appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how
                        robotics and artificial intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her
                        reputation extends beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first
                        United Nation Innovation Champion by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an
                        official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights
                        and equality.
                        Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and
                        remarkable story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology
                        story.

                        Sophia’s creator, Dr. David Hanson, is the founder of Hanson Robotics and a modern-day
                        renaissance man who has built a worldwide reputation for creating robots that look and act
                        amazingly human. After working at Disney as an “Imagineer,” Dr. Hanson aspired to create genius
                        machines that will surpass human intelligence. Dr. Hanson believes that three distinctively
                        human traits must be integrated into the artificial intelligence of these genius machines:
                        Creativity, empathy, and compassion. As an extension of human intelligence, Hanson Robotics’
                        genius machines can evolve to solve world problems too complex for humans to solve themselves.
                        Sophia personifies this bold and responsible goal.
                        Please follow Sophia’s journey to observe and engage with her as she develops into an exciting
                        platform for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and service robotics applications in
                        business, medical/healthcare, and education.

                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                        the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                        but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
                        Lorem Ipsum.
                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                        Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin
                        words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32
                        and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
                        section 1.10.32.
                        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                        Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
                        in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
                        Rackham.
                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                        when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                        distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                        readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
                        their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in
                        their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                        purpose (injected humour and the like).
                        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                        alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
                        believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
                        anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
                        Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on
                        the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
                        sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum
                        is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
